## A Note About this Project
This repo (bootstrapped with create-react-app) is the final student project for Udacity's Front-End Web Development course. One of the positive aspects from being so behind in the course was the ability to learn from others as they progressed through this project for months before me. I learned a lot from what they shared on Slack creating a rather large gist for later reference--certainly useful. My decision to utilize the Google-Maps-React library was a direct result of putting the experiences of others to work for me.

## Online Resources
In addition to review of my gist and picking the brains of my cohort on our Slack channel I watched several student/instructor tutorials and reviewed online sources.
